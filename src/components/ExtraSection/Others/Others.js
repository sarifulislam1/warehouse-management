                        A mission statement is more than a piece of paper. It defines a business's corporate values, guides its employees, and differentiates it from competitors. Many of the largest grocery stores and supermarkets in the U.S. have a mission statement.Because of the dominance of national food brands, the products and pricing offered at stores and chains that compete with each other are usually indistinguishable. This is where a mission statement becomes important.
                        The mission statement of each major retail grocery store and supermarket chain accomplishes three things: It defines the brand, the culture, and the customer experience. Each mission, vision, and values statement is as unique as the shopping experience at the supermarket it represents.
